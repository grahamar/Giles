# Giles The Librarian

## Getting Started

### Who Is Giles?
Giles loves documentation, he'll look after your documentation for you. Keep it versioned and in an orderly fashion.
In other words, Giles is a simple documentation repository app, strongly influenced by the awesome project [readthedocs.org](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org).

Giles can pull from your Git repository, and scour every tagged version as well as the HEAD, for documentation (Giles only reads markdown at the moment...), store it in a Mongo database and index it for your perusal.

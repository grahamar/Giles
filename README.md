### Who Is Giles?
Giles loves documentation, he'll look after your documentation for you. Keep it versioned and in an orderly fashion.
In other words, Giles is a simple documentation repository app, strongly influenced by the awesome project
[readthedocs.org](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org).

Writing documentation is not an easy task, Giles knows this, but lucky for you, Giles loves documentation! So he wants
to make the rest of the process as easy as possible for you. Giles can pull from your Git repository, and scour every
tagged version as well as the HEAD, for documentation (Giles only reads markdown at the moment...), store it in a Mongo
database and index it for your perusal.
